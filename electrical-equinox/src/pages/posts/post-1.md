# Starting the Journey

I kicked off my Astro journey with excitement, setting up my first blog and getting familiar with the framework. Installing Astro and creating my first pages felt straightforward, and I quickly learned how Markdown posts work. This was my introduction to structuring a site using Astro, and I was eager to keep going!

## What I`ve accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project and set up my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown posts!

## What`s next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come.
